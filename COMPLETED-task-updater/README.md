The JS file which contains this completed project can be found at COMPLETED-task-updater/dist/main.js . That file contains the entire app's code.  

In our Drupal site, we placed that file at this location:  
- drupal/web/themes/custom/reactive_theme/js/react-int-fields.js  
- The file was copy & pasted out of this folder and renamed from main.js to react-int-fields.js.
